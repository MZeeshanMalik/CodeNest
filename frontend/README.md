# CodeNest Frontend

![CodeNest Homepage](frontend/public/homepage.png)

CodeNest is a comprehensive platform designed to connect developers, facilitate knowledge sharing, and build a supportive coding community. This frontend implementation enables users to ask programming questions, share code snippets, write technical blogs, and engage with content through voting, commenting, and more.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The frontend is built using Next.js 13+ with App Router, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It follows a modern, component-based architecture with a focus on performance, SEO, and user experience:

- **App Router**: Leverages Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for shared functionality
- **Services**: API integration and data fetching
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
